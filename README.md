# Special Rooms in Greed Mode
Allow special rooms to generate in place of the curse room in Greed Mode.

This includes all the special rooms that can generate outside of Greed Mode: Arcades, Vaults, Challenge Rooms, Sacrifice Rooms, Libraries, Isaac's Room/Barren Room, Chest Rooms, Dice Rooms, and Planetariums.

Partially based on kittenchilly's own version at https://github.com/kittenchilly/GreedModeSpecialRooms , though about 80% of the code from there has been rewritten at this point.
