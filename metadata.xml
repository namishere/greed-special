    <description>Don't you think that having only Curse Rooms in Greed Mode is dumb? Well, this mod fixes this!
Now Curse Rooms have a chance to be replaced by: Dice Rooms, Chest Rooms, Challenge Rooms, Libraries and Arcades, Barren Rooms, Isaac's Room and Planetariums! (Only if you don't have Planetariums in Greed Mode mod)

This mod is compatible with:
